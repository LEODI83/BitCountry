In the Sendin form, we see our address from which we make a purchase

In the wallet window, an up-to-date information appears about the amount of gas write-off (commission) and the total amount of spent tokens

In this example, we see that when the gas price is less than 148 gwei, the wallet automatically offered to opt for a commission of $28

To check the gas price, we use the service - https://etherscan.io/gastracker

And we see that at a price of 118 gwei, for a transaction using ERC-20 tokens, we will have to pay about $35

After a few seconds (10-30 seconds), a window opens with our transaction and we see the actually spent ETH in the form of a commission (in our example, with a gas price of 130 gwei, we paid only $25.44)
